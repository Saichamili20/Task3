Project Title:
Exploring Financial Inclusion Across Demographics Using Power BI

Overview:
This Power BI dashboard analyzes financial inclusion across various demographic factors using a dataset derived from the Kaggle Financial Inclusion Survey. The focus is on identifying patterns in bank account ownership, examining influential factors, and uncovering inequalities based on gender, education, location, job type, and mobile access.

Objectives:
Understand which factors influence bank account ownership.

Compare access to financial services across gender, age, job type, and country.

Use Power BI’s Key Influencer visual to detect strong predictors of financial inclusion.

Deliver meaningful insights in a clean, interactive dashboard format.

Dataset Summary:
Source: Kaggle Financial Inclusion Survey

Region: East African countries (Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda)

Target Variable: Has Bank Account (Yes/No)

Features Analyzed:

Gender

Education Level

Job Type

Location (Urban/Rural)

Marital Status

Cellphone Access

Age

 Dashboard Highlights:
Location vs Education – Bar chart to show education levels across rural and urban settings.

Job vs Bank Account by Location – Stacked bar visual to reveal bank account ownership by job type and region.

Key Influencer Visual – Detects that cellphone access is a key driver of bank account ownership.

Job Type Categorization – Pie chart to show the population distribution by employment type.

Bank Account vs Cell Access by Country – Dual-axis line chart to compare mobile access and account ownership across countries.

Marital Status vs Cell Access – Tree map visual showing household cellphone access by marital group.

Bank Access by Age – Histogram visual exploring how bank access varies with respondent age.

 Key Insights:
Cellphone access is a major influencer for having a bank account.

Rural residents have less education and fewer bank accounts compared to urban dwellers.

Women are less likely to have bank accounts, particularly if they are from rural areas or have low education levels.

Formally employed individuals are much more likely to be financially included than those informally or self-employed.

Age group 25–45 appears to be the most financially active in terms of bank account ownership.

Tools Used:
Microsoft Power BI

Power BI AI Visual: Key Influencer

Custom visualizations: Bar chart, pie chart, tree map, line chart, histogram, slicers

Future Improvements:
Replace pie chart with bar/column chart for clearer category comparisons.

Add map visual to explore geographic patterns of financial inclusion.

Include decomposition tree for multi-level drill-down.

Add export to PDF or PowerPoint option for stakeholders.

Learning Outcome:
This project demonstrates how to use Power BI for data storytelling, uncover patterns in social data, and apply AI tools like Key Influencer to support data-driven decisions for policy and financial planning.
